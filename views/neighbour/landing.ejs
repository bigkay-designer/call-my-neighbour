            <p>We are a group of two people, who set out to bring the community together. Due to the stress we
                experience because of the lockdown it is increasingly difficult to skip the feeling of loneliness.
                We want to show that we can be close to each other and follow the rules at the same time.
                with that being said Let's help out our friends, families and neighbours.
                This is the time when we can make things right.
                <span class="bold">Join us to promote kindness through small things that will make us proud. </span></p>

                <p>I’m really excited about callmyneighbour. I know it will be a great tool for bringing our neighbourhood together, whether that’s to find other people who want to put on a street party—or to fundraise and volunteer with local charities. The possibilities are endless!<p>

                <p>It can be difficult to get to know our neighbours and what is going on locally. I’m hoping that callmyneighbour will be the answer to getting to know our neighbours in the digital age?</p>

                <p>If you care about your neighbourhood, callmyneighbour is the place for you. I’m looking forward to using it to get recommendations on great local businesses. Too few people near me know the neighbours, and I know that will change with the arrival of callmyneighbour.</p>
